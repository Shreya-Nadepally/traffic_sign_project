# traffic_sign_project
This project uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning model to detect and classify various traffic signs from images and videos. It helps in identifying traffic symbols such as speed limits, stop signs, and warning signs — which can be useful for autonomous driving systems and road safety applications.
## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for training is the **German Traffic Sign Dataset (GTSRB Preprocessed)**.

📂 **Source:** [Kaggle - Traffic Signs Preprocessed Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valentynsichkar/traffic-signs-preprocessed)

It contains over **50,000 labeled images** of 43 different traffic sign classes, preprocessed for computer vision tasks.
